"In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn't read all the time -- none, zero.
You'd be amazed how much Warren reads--and at how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I'm a book with a couple of legs sticking out."
- Charlie T. Munger

The personal purpose of creating this website is to detail my journey of literature reading. Along the journey I hope to sharpen my writing skills and convey my thoughts in a simple but clear manner. Qouting Albert Einstein, "Everything should be made as simple as possible, nut not simpler" will serve to be one of many core principles I will strive for.

The reader's benefit will be to gain insightful insights on books I have read and how it relates to the world today. Most books that are 300+ pages long have a number of insights that are far and few between. My job will be to carefully read and reread line by line and conver a book into a short 3 page or less post filled with insights. This will not be a book review but second order thinking.

As I embark on this life long journey, I hope to improve myself every day. As always, I am open to feedback and/or cirticism in order to improve myself.

Best Regards,
John Lee
